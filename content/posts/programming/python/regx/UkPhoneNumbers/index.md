# Validation UK Phone Numbers With Python and Regular Expressions

To validate phone numbers, we need to consider the common formats for UK phone numbers. Generally, UK phone numbers have the following characteristics:

Landline numbers typically start with '01', '02', '03', or '084', followed by 9 or 10 digits.
Mobile numbers start with '07' and are followed by 9 digits.
We'll use regular expressions (regex) to match these patterns. Let's write the function and the unit tests.
