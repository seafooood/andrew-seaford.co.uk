# Weekly Performance Improvement Project

## Aim
The primary aim of this weekly project is to systematically improve the search engine performance of the andrew-seaford.co.uk website, focusing on metrics such as Click-Through Rate (CTR), organic traffic, and keyword rankings. This will be achieved through a continuous cycle of experimentation, data analysis, and iterative improvements.

## Process
Each week will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Data Collection:** Manual download of updated analytics data from Google Search Console (Performance and Page Indexing reports) and Google Analytics.
2.  **Experiment Review:** Analyze the results of the previous week's experiment against its hypothesis and baseline data. Document conclusions and learnings.
3.  **New Experiment Design:** Based on current analytics and learnings, identify a new target (article, keyword, page type), formulate a clear hypothesis, and define specific changes to be made.
4.  **Documentation:** Create or update dedicated markdown files for the experiment details and associated tasks.
5.  **Implementation:** Implement the defined changes on the website.

This iterative process ensures that we are constantly testing, learning, and making data-driven decisions to enhance the site's visibility and user engagement.

## Data Collection

Each week the two sets of data will be exported from Google Search Console.

The overall site performance will be in the folder `/home/andrew/Code/andrew-seaford.co.uk/experiments/Google Search Console - Performance`.
eg
`/home/andrew/Code/andrew-seaford.co.uk/experiments/Google Search Console - Performance/http___www.andrew-seaford.co.uk_-Performance-on-Search-2026-02-09.zip`

The Page Indexing will be in the folder ``/home/andrew/Code/andrew-seaford.co.uk/experiments/Google Search Console - Page Indexing/`
eg
`/home/andrew/Code/andrew-seaford.co.uk/experiments/Google Search Console - Page Indexing/http___www.andrew-seaford.co.uk_-Coverage-2026-02-09.zip`

The export files are zip containing the data in csv format.

## Goal for this week's experiment: Increase Organic Click-Through Rate (CTR)
