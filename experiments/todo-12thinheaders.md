# 12. Thin Heading Structure in Docs

**Problem:** Most doc pages have only an H1 (the title) and possibly one H2 ("Related Files"). Content lacks descriptive subheadings that help Google understand page structure and can appear as featured snippets.

**Fix:** Break up longer tutorials into sections with descriptive H2/H3 headings. For example, instead of a single code block, use headings like "Prerequisites", "Step 1: Configure the environment", "Expected output", etc.

**Impact:** Low-medium - improves content structure signals and featured snippet eligibility.
