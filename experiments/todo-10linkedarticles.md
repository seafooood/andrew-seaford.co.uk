# 10. Limited Cross-Linking Between Related Content

**Problem:** Most doc pages only have a "Related Files" section linking to GitHub. There are no "See Also" or "Related Articles" links to other pages on the site. This reduces:
- Time on site
- Pages per session
- Internal link equity distribution
- Crawl depth

**Fix:** Add "Related Tutorials" sections at the bottom of doc pages linking to 2-3 related articles on the site.

**Impact:** Medium - improves user engagement and helps Google discover and rank more pages.
