# 7. Missing/Poor Image Alt Text

**Problem:** Many images use filenames as alt text or have no descriptive alt text:
```markdown
![IMG_20161114_044023-300x300.jpg](images/IMG_20161114_044023-300x300.jpg)
![whited-toothbrush-flower](images/Whited-Toothbrush-Flower-182x300.png)
```

**Fix:** Update image alt text to be descriptive of the image content. For example:
```markdown
![3D printed toothbrush holder in white PLA](images/Whited-Toothbrush-Flower-182x300.png)
```

**Impact:** Medium - affects image search traffic and accessibility.
