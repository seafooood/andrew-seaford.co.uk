# Oversized "TOILET" Keyring for Workshops & Garages

This is a large, spanner-shaped keyring designed specifically for the essential keys that always seem to go missing in a busy shared environment like a garage or workshop. Clearly and humorously labeled "TOILET," this keyring is a practical and robust solution to a common problem.

## The Problem:
In a busy garage, keys for common areas like the restroom are handled by many different people throughout the day. Standard-sized keys are small, easily forgotten, and can accidentally slip into a pocket and be taken home. This leads to frustrating searches, wasted time, and the potential need to cut new keys.

## The Solution:
This oversized keyring is designed with a simple but effective principle in mind: make it impossible to forget and awkward to pocket.

* Large and Unwieldy: At 18cm (approx. 7 inches) long, the keyring is substantial. Its size and shape make it immediately noticeable and uncomfortable to put in a pocket, strongly encouraging users to return it to its designated hook immediately after use.

* Clear Identification: The large, debossed text "TOILET" instantly identifies the key's purpose, avoiding confusion with other vehicle or tool-chest keys.

* Robust and Thematic Design: The spanner shape is a perfect fit for a garage or workshop environment. It's a fun, thematic design that is also highly durable when 3D printed with standard materials like PLA or PETG.

* Easy to 3D Print: The model is a single, solid piece designed to be printed flat on the bed of any standard 3D printer (20x20cm or larger) without needing complex supports.

This isn't just a keyring; it's a practical key management solution. By making the key difficult to lose, you ensure it's always available when needed, saving everyone time and hassle.
