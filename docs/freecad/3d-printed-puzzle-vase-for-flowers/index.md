## Design

The vase is made up of 15 pieces across three distinct part types, all designed in FreeCAD. The parts snap together without glue or fasteners, relying on interlocking slots for a sturdy, tool-free assembly.

### Disk With Holes (Top)

The top disk serves as both the structural hub and the flower holder. It features 15 cutouts evenly spaced around its edge, into which the side pieces slot. The centre of the disk contains 21 holes arranged in concentric circles — 6 holes in the inner ring, 9 in the middle ring, and 6 in the outer ring — each sized to hold a single flower stem upright. The hole layout was generated programmatically in FreeCAD using a Python macro to ensure precise, even spacing.

### Disk Bottom (Base)

The base disk mirrors the top disk's outer profile, with 15 matching cutouts around its edge for the side pieces to slot into. It provides a flat, stable foundation for the assembled vase.

### Edge (Side Pieces)

The side pieces connect the top and bottom disks, forming the walls of the vase. Each piece slots into the cutouts on both disks, locking the structure together. 13 identical side pieces are needed to complete the vase.
