# Installing MySQL with phpMyAdmin

The fastest way to get started is to install LAMP using tasksel. Tasksel is a Debian/Ubuntu tool that installs multiple related packages as a co-ordinated “task” onto your system.

At a terminal prompt enter the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y tasksel
sudo tasksel install lamp-server
```
