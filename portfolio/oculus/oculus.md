## What is Meares-Irlen Syndrome

Meares-Irlen Syndrome, (also known as Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome or Visual Stress) is the term used to describe a number of symptoms which make reading difficult and often unpleasant.

## How can Oculus help?

The Oculus application helps people, both adults and children, by adjusting the default Window's white background colour to a colour which is more pleasant for reading.
