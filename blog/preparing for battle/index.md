This year Team Seaford will be competing in the non-destructive robot competition [Pi Wars 2017](http://piwars.org/), where robot controlled by Raspberry Pi’s will compete in a range of robotics challenges.

The brains for this years robot will be the [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) that we won in Pi Wars 2015.

Please, follow our progress as we build our robot. [![](images/IMG_20161114_044023-300x300.jpg)](http://www.andrew-seaford.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20161114_044023.jpg)
