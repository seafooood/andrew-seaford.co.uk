I’m happy to share that my new extension, Project Identity, is now live on the VS Code Marketplace.

Project Identity helps developers distinguish between multiple VS Code instances at a glance. It allows you to instantly differentiate workspaces by customizing the window title and applying distinct color schemes to the title and status bars. Visual context is crucial when you are juggling multiple projects. I built Project Identity to make it immediately obvious which environment you are working in. It’s particularly useful when working with multiple forks or microservices simultaneously. It’s a simple tool designed to reduce cognitive load and prevent "wrong window" errors.
