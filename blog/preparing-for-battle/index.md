This year Team Seaford will be competing in the non-destructive robot competition [Pi Wars 2017](http://piwars.org/), where robot controlled by Raspberry Pi’s will compete in a range of robotics challenges.
<!-- truncate -->
The brains for this years robot will be the [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) that we won in Pi Wars 2015.

Please, follow our progress as we build our robot.
